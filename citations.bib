	abstract = {Hops are natural ingredients used to impart bitterness and flavor to beer. Recently, new varieties of hops have attracted global research attention. The Sorachi Ace variety, in particular, interests many craft brewers. This hop imparts characteristic varietal aromas, including woody, pine-like, citrus, dill-like, and lemongrass-like, to finished beers. Here, we investigated specific flavor compounds derived from Sorachi Ace using selectable one-dimensional or two-dimensional gas chromatography--olfactometry/mass spectrometry and head space-solid phase microextraction--gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. The results showed that a unique volatile compound, geranic acid, was present at a significant level only in the test beer brewed with the Sorachi Ace hop. Furthermore, sensory evaluation techniques revealed that geranic acid has very unique characteristics. This compound is not odor-active but functions as an enhancer for hop-derived terpenoids at subthreshold levels.},

	abstract = {Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) is a perennial plant used mainly in the brewing industry because of its bitter and aromatic substances. Consequently, hop varieties are divided into two groups: those with aroma and those with high α-acid content. Since the Slovenian varieties are all of the aroma type, the development of a variety with a high α-acid content was our objective. 'Dana' (Reg. No. CV-29, PI 665033), which was developed at the Slovenian Institute of Hop Research and Brewing through screening and breeding techniques, expresses an aromatic hop character as well as a high α-acid content. It has brewing characteristics that are comparable with other hop varieties that are well known worldwide, giving Dana the opportunity to be a very good substitute for them in the brewing industry. Dana is moderately resistant to primary downy mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli Miyabe and Takah. G.W. Wilson) infection, has resistance to secondary downy mildew infections of cones, and has established virus- and viroid-free nuclear stock material. The release of Dana should increase the production of the α-acid group in Slovenia, since it is the first high-α-acid-content variety produced in Slovenia that is well adapted to Slovenian pedoclimatic conditions.},

@article{10.1094-ASBCJ-2017-1720-01,
	abstract = { Mosaic (brand HBC 369) is a new flavor hop variety having unique and highly favored flavor characteristics. Mosaic was developed and released by the Hop Breeding Company LLC (HBC) and is protected by a U.S. plant patent (''Hop Plant Named 'HBC 369'''). Mosaic's maternal parent, YCR 14 (Simcoe), is a commercial cultivar with a unique aroma but with relatively low yield and susceptibility to powdery mildew. YCR 14 was crossed to a male plant with powdery mildew resistance and high yield in its genetic background, with the ultimate goal of creating a commercial cultivar with unique aromatic/flavoring characteristics, resistance to powdery mildew, and good yield. HBC 369 (Mosaic) was selected from this cross on that basis. Mosaic has a unique aroma combined with high α-acid content, powdery mildew tolerance, and exceptional yield. To date, flavor testing of beer brewed with Mosaic, both at pilot and commercial scale, has brought about an enthusiastic response from brewers and tasters, and the future of this new hop variety looks promising. The aroma/flavor descriptors used commonly include fruity (blueberry), citrus (tangerine, grapefruit), tropical (mango, guava), floral, and earthy. The combination of these aroma/flavor descriptors with the relatively high α-acid levels allows this hop to serve a dual purpose, as both a bittering and flavor/aroma hop in the brewing process. Ultimately, Mosaic provides flavor and aroma profiles in beer that cannot be accomplished with other hop cultivars. },

Its genetic composition is 0.5 Petham Golding, 0.25 Brewer's Gold and 0.25 Utah wild hop. In trials in Washington, Oregon and Idaho it had average α-acid and β-acid contents of >12% and >3.5%, respectively. Yields of Chinook, in Washington and Idaho compared favourably to average hop yields in those states. Brewing evaluations have been favourable. Chinook is moderately resistant to Pseudoperonospora humuli and is free of Prunus necrotic ringspot virus and apple mosaic virus. },

	abstract = {Unlike most fermentation alcohol beverage production processes, brewers recycle their yeast. This is achieved by employing a yeast culture's: flocculation, adhesion, sedimentation, flotation, and cropping characteristics. As a consequence of yeast recycling, the quality of the cropped yeast culture's characteristics is critical. However, the other major function of brewer's yeast is to metabolise wort into ethanol, carbon dioxide, glycerol, and other fermentation products, many of which contribute to beer's overall flavour characteristics. This review will only focus on brewer's yeast flocculation characteristics.},

The spatial configurations derived from individual profiles are rationalised by generalised Procrustes statistics. The result is a consensus configuration revealing the interrelationships between the samples for the panel as a whole. An experiment conducted on commercial ports using ten assessors, both expert and non-expert, illustrates the technique.},

Collectively these may be regarded asm configurations, or scalings, each ofn points inp-dimensions. The problem is investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling them configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion Σi=1mΣi=1nΔ2(Pj(i)Gi), whereGiis the centroid of them pointsPi(i)(i = 1, 2, ...,m). The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be summarized in analysis of variance form. The special casem = 2 corresponds to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed.},

@article{https://doi.org/10.1002/jib.160,
	abstract = {The hop cones of the female plant of the common hop species Humulus lupulus L. are grown almost exclusively for the brewing industry. Only the cones of the female plants are able to secrete the fine yellow resinous powder (i.e. lupulin glands). It is in these lupulin glands that the main brewing principles of hops, the resins and essential oils, are synthesized and accumulated. Hops are of interest to the brewer since they impart the typical bitter taste and aroma to beer and are responsible for the perceived hop character. In addition to the comfortable bitterness and the refreshing hoppy aroma delivered by hops, the hop acids also contribute to the overall microbial stability of beer. Another benefit of the hop resins is that they help enhance and stabilize beer foam and promote foam lacing. In an attempt to understand these contributions, the very complex nature of the chemical composition of hops is reviewed. First, a general overview of the hop chemistry and nomenclature is presented. Then, the different hop resins found in the lupulin glands of the hop cones are discussed in detail. The major hop bitter acids (α- and β-acids) and the latest findings on the absolute configuration of the cis and trans iso-α-acids are discussed. Special attention is given to the hard resins; the known δ-resin is reviewed and the ε-resin is introduced. Recent data on the bittering potential and the antimicrobial properties of both hard resin fractions are disclosed. Attention is also given to the numerous essential oil constituents as well as their contributions to beer aroma. In addition to the aroma contribution of the well-known essential oil compounds, a number of recently identified sulfur compounds and their impact on beer aroma are reviewed. The hop polyphenols and their potential health benefits are also addressed. Subsequently, the importance of hops in brewing is examined and the contributions of hops to beer quality are explained. Finally, the beer and hop market of the last century, as well as the new trends in brewing, are discussed in detail. Hop research is an ever growing field of central importance to the brewing industry, even in areas that are not traditionally associated with hops and brewing. This article attempts to give a general overview of the different areas of hop research while assessing the latest advances in hop science and their impact on brewing.

    abstract = {In order to structurally design a silo, an engineer must determine all loads that are likely to be applied to it. These include, among others, wind, seismic, external, and loads induced by the stored bulk solid. Numerous codes and standards specify means to calculate the latter (so-called solids-induced loads). Among them, the four most common in use in the world today are:•British Standard BS EN 1991-4:2006 “Eurocode 1 – Actions on structures – Part 4: Silos and Tanks”•American Concrete Institute ACI 313-97 “Standard practice for design and construction of concrete silos and stacking tubes for storing granular materials”•American Society of Agricultural Engineers ANSI/ASAE EP433 DEC1988 (R2011) “Loads exerted by free-flowing grain on bins”•Australian Standard AS 3774-1996 “Loads on bulk solids containers” Unfortunately, guidance to the user is inconsistent between these codes. In addition, many common silo design conditions are not covered by any of them. A brief description of each of these codes, their limitations, and common design conditions that are not covered are identified. Users of silo codes will find this information invaluable, as will code writers who will benefit by being given direction as to how to improve their codes to make them more useful.}}
