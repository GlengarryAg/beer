<p>The promise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">Resource Description Framework</a> is in two parts: a distributed knowledge graph with
url-style identifiers and support for making statements about them.  The
<i>syntax</i> of the RDF data model has been widely adopted for several
applications using different serializations (rdf/xml, json-ld, turtle, etc...),
including bibliography, search engine optimization and API integrations. 
Occasionally, providers will even offer the same data in several serializations
using transparent content negotiation to let client libraries choose the optimal
serialization.</p>

<p>The promise of RDF with strong knowledge management through standards
such as <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF/S</a>, <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/">OWL</a> and later <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">SHACL</a> remains to be fully realized as
many data providers see RDF as a schema mechanism rather than a knowledge
management or ontological one.</p>

<p>The W3 ontologies for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">time</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">prov</a> and 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/">SOSA/SSN</a> are used as the basis for most terms, the <a href="https://bibliontology.com/">Bibo</a> ontologies for citations /
references and the OGC <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/geosparql">GeoSparql</a> standard is used for spatial data.  Other ontologies are referenced on an as-needed basis
depending on the domain.  Commercially and trade oriented data is recorded using both the <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> and <a href="https://www.gs1.org/voc/">GS1</a> vocabularies. Whenever possible, physical measurements are reported in both imperial and metric units using the <a href="https://www.qudt.org/">qudt</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/">obo</a> ontologies.</p>

<p>This ontology is designed to be used as both a fully fledged ontology (in RDF/S and OWL) with complex reasoning capability and a
schema-driven dataset for simple querying.  As such, it contains a significant amount of redundant information and materialized
reflective properties that are designed to maintain compatibility and usefulness in multiple environments.  Developers that are
used to reading raw RDF statements to locate the relevant information may find it easier to build a query directly from the
documentation rather than reading the machine code.</p>

<p>Lastly, while few environments can support OWL at its full capacity, this
ontology is useful in the development of applications requiring multilingual
labeling, term translation and long term entity identifiers for form
generation and reporting.</p>
